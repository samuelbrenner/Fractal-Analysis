	abstract = {Cold dark clouds are nearby members of the densest and coldest phase in the galactic interstellar medium, and represent the most accessible sites where stars like our Sun are currently being born. In this review we discuss recent progress in their study, including the newly discovered infrared dark clouds that are likely precursors to stellar clusters. At large scales, dark clouds present filamentary mass distributions with motions dominated by supersonic turbulence. At small, sub-parsec scales, a population of subsonic starless cores provides a unique glimpse of the conditions prior to stellar birth. Recent studies of starless cores reveal a combination of simple physical properties together with a complex chemical structure dominated by the freeze-out of molecules onto cold dust grains. Elucidating this combined structure is both an observational and theoretical challenge whose solution will bring us closer to understanding how molecular gas condenses to form stars.},

	abstract = {Multifractal scaling (MFS) refers to structures that can be described as a collection of interwoven fractal subsets which exhibit power-law spatial scaling behavior with a range of scaling exponents (concentration, or singularity, strengths) and dimensions. The existence of MFS implies an underlying multiplicative (or hierarchical, or cascade) process. Panoramic column density images of several nearby star-forming cloud complexes, constructed from IRAS data, are shown to exhibit such multifractal scaling, which we interpret as indirect but quantitative evidence for nested hierarchical structure. The relation between the dimensions of the subsets and their concentration strengths (the "multifractal spectrum") appears to satisfactorily order the observed regions in terms of the mixture of geometries present, from strong point-like concentrations, to line-like filaments or fronts, to space-filling diffuse structures. This multifractal spectrum is a global property of the regions studied, and does not rely on any operational definition of "clouds." The range of forms of the multifractal spectrum among the regions studied implies that the column density structures do not form a universality class, in contrast to indications for velocity and passive scalar fields in incompressible turbulence, providing another indication that the physics of highly compressible interstellar gas dynamics differs fundamentally from incompressible turbulence. There is no correlation between the geometrical properties of the regions studied and their level of internal star formation activity, a result that is also apparent from visual inspection. We discuss the viability of the multifractal spectrum as a measure of the structural "complexity" of the regions studied, and emphasize the problematic dependence of all structural descriptors on the subjective pre-selection of the region to be described. A comparison of IRAS 100 µm column density (not intensity) images with 13CO, visual extinction, and C18O data suggests that structural details are captured by IRAS up to at least 30 magnitudes of visual extinction, except in the vicinity of embedded stars, and that lower-column density connective structure not seen by other methods is revealed.},

@article{Elmegreen2001,
	abstract = {Three-dimensional fractal models on grids of 2003 pixels are generated from the inverse Fourier transform of noise with a power law cutoff, exponentiated to give a log normal distribution of density. The fractals are clipped at various intensity levels and the mass and size distribution functions of the clipped peaks and their subpeaks are determined. These distribution functions are analogous to the cloud mass functions determined from maps of the fractal interstellar medium using various thresholds for the definition of a cloud. The model mass functions are found to be power laws with powers ranging from -1.6 to -2.4 in linear mass intervals as the clipping level increases from 0.03 to 0.3 of the peak intensity. The low clipping value gives a cloud filling factor of 0.1 and should be a good model for molecular cloud surveys. The agreement between the mass spectrum of this model and the observed cloud and clump mass spectra suggests that a pervasively fractal interstellar medium can be interpreted as a cloud/intercloud medium if the peaks of the fractal intensity distribution are taken to be clouds. Their mass function is a power law even though the density distribution function in the gas is a log-normal. This is because the size distribution function of the clipped clouds is a power law, and with clipping, each cloud has about the same average density. A similar result would apply to projected clouds that are clipped fractals, giving nearly constant column densities for power law mass functions. The steepening of the mass function for higher clip values suggests a partial explanation for the steeper slope of the mass functions for star clusters and OB associations, which sample denser regions of interstellar gas.},

	abstract = {Interstellar molecular clouds have power-law size L and mass M distributions of the form n(L)dL = L-$\alpha$LdL and n(M)dM = M-$\alpha$MdM, where M LK is also a power law. These relations are shown to result from the fractal and scale-free nature of interstellar gas with power indices that are independent of distance. The results are $\alpha$L = 1 + D and $\alpha$M = 1 + D/K for interstellar fractal dimension D = 2.30.3 and a value of K in the range 2.4-3.7, as determined from cloud surveys in the literature. The same fractal dimension also results from the expected relation D = K when the M(L) correlation includes many different surveys, spanning a range of 1010 in mass. These results imply that interstellar CO clouds are the unresolved parts of a pervasive fractal structure in the interstellar gas. The similarity between n(M) for interstellar clouds and n(M) for globular clusters suggests that the clusters formed inside fractal progenitor clouds at a nearly constant efficiency.},

	abstract = {Fascinating and authoritative, Chaos and Fractals: New Frontiers of Science is a truly remarkable book that documents recent discoveries in chaos theory with plenty of mathematical detail, but without alienating the general reader. In all, this text offers an extremely rich and engaging tour of this quite revolutionary branch of mathematical research. The most appealing aspect about Chaos and Fractals has to be its hundreds of images and graphics (with dozens in full-color) used to illustrate key concepts. Even the math-averse reader should be able to follow the basic presentation of chaos and fractals here. Since fractals often mimic natural shapes such as mountains, plants, and other biological forms, they lend themselves especially well to visual representation. Early chapters here document the mathematical oddities (or "monsters") such as the Sierpinski Gasket and the Koch Curve, which laid the groundwork for later discoveries in fractals. The book does a fine job of placing recent discoveries about chaos into a tradition of earlier mathematical research. Its description of the work of mathematicians like Pascal, Kepler, Poincar\'{e}, Sierpinski, Koch, and Mandelbrot makes for a fine read, a detective story that ends with the discovery of order in chaos. (For programmers, the authors provide short algorithms and BASIC code, which lets you try out plotting various fractals on your own.) This is not, however, only a book of pretty pictures. For the reader who needs the mathematics behind chaos theory, the authors in no way dumb down the details. (But because the richer mathematical material is set off from the main text, the general reader can still make headway without getting lost.) There have been advances in the field since this book's publication in 1992, but Chaos and Fractals remains an authoritative general reference on chaos theory and fractals. A must for math students (and math enthusiasts), Chaos and Fractals also deserves a place on the bookshelf of any general reader or programmer who wants to understand how today's mathematicians and scientists make sense of our world using chaos theory. -Richard Dragan Topics covered: Overview of fractals and chaos theory, feedback and multiple reduction copy machines (MRCMs), the Cantor Set, the Sierpinski Gasket and Carpet, the Pascal Triangle, the Koch Curve, Julia Sets, similarity, measuring fractal curves, fractal dimensions, transformations and contraction mapping, image compression, chaos games, fractals and nature, L-systems, cellular automata basics, attractors and strange attractors, Henon's Attractor, R\"{o}ssler and Lorenz Attractors, randomness in fractals, the Brownian motion, fractal landscapes, sensitivity and periodic points, complex arithmetic basics, the Mandelbrot Set, and multifractal measures. -This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.},

@article{Plewa2004,
	abstract = {We present a new mechanism for Type Ia supernova explosions in massive white dwarfs. The proposed scenario follows from relaxing the assumption of symmetry in the model and involves a detonation created in an unconfined environment. The explosion begins with an essentially central ignition of stellar material initiating a deflagration. This deflagration results in the formation of a buoyantly-driven bubble of hot material that reaches the stellar surface at supersonic speeds. The bubble breakout forms a strong pressure wave that laterally accelerates fuel-rich outer stellar layers. This material, confined by gravity to the white dwarf, races along the stellar surface and is focused at the location opposite to the point of the bubble breakout. These streams of nuclear fuel carry enough mass and energy to trigger a detonation just above the stellar surface. The flow conditions at that moment support a detonation that will incinerate the white dwarf and result in an energetic explosion. The stellar expansion following the deflagration redistributes stellar mass in a way that ensures production of intermediate mass and iron group elements consistent with observations. The ejecta will have a strongly layered structure with a mild amount of asymmetry following from the early deflagration phase. This asymmetry, combined with the amount of stellar expansion determined by details of the evolution (principally the energetics of deflagration, timing of detonation, and structure of the progenitor), can be expected to create a family of mildly diverse Type Ia supernova explosions.},

	abstract = {Physical variables in scale invariant systems often show chaotic, turbulent-like behavior, commonly associated to the existence of an underlying fractal or multifractal structure. However, the assessment of multifractality over experimental, discretized data requires of appropriate methods and to establish criteria to measure the confidence degree on the estimates. In this paper we have evaluated the quality of different techniques used for multifractal analysis. We have tested four different techniques: the moment (M) method, the wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) method, the gradient modulus wavelet projection (GMWP) method and the gradient histogram (GH) method, which are used to estimate the singularity spectra of multifractal signals. The test consists in analyzing synthetic multifractal 1D signals with given multifractal spectrum. We have compared the results, studying the sensibility of each method to the length of the series, size of the ensemble and type of spectrum. Our results show that GMWP method is the one attaining the best performance, providing reliable estimates which can be improved when the statistics is increased. All the other methods are affected by problems such as the linearization of the right tail of the spectrum, and some of them are very demanding in data.},

Starting with the classical potential flow theory for moving contact surfaces, the discussion extends to various fluid systems describing inhomogeneous, viscous, compressible, and isobaric flows. Thereby an overview on the major stability issues under a broad variety of physical conditions can be given. In particular, the stability analysis is addressed to layered materials in plane and spherical geometries under various dynamical conditions, to inhomogeneous media with variable gradients and different boundary conditions, to viscous boundary layers, compressible atmospheres, and to stationary ablation fronts in laser-driven plasma experiments. The stability theory is further extended to the nonlinear stage of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and to a discussion of bubble dynamics in two and three dimensions for closed and open bubble domains. For this purpose simple flow models are studied that can describe essential features of bubble rise and bubble growth in buoyancy-driven mixing layers.},
